# BTC Model Performance Analysis

## Training Results Summary (2025-06-22)

### Model Performance Comparison

| Timeframe | Best Epoch | Val Loss | MAPE | R² Score | Status |
|-----------|------------|----------|------|----------|--------|
| 30m       | 134        | 0.1889   | 1.05% | -0.3410  | ✅ Good |
| 1h        | 134        | 0.1889   | 1.05% | -0.3410  | ✅ Good |
| 4h        | 12         | 0.0744   | 0.65% | 0.5311   | ✅ Excellent |
| 24h       | 16         | 0.0460   | 3.50% | -1.9305  | ⚠️ Poor |

### Key Observations

#### ✅ Resolved Issues:
1. **Price Scale Fixed**: All models now train on correct BTC price range (~100K)
2. **Data Source Working**: CoinGecko integration functioning properly
3. **Technical Indicators**: All 26 features generated correctly
4. **Model Architecture**: LSTM with proper hyperparameters

#### ⚠️ Performance Issues:

**24-hour Model Problems:**
- **Negative R² (-1.9305)**: Model performs worse than baseline mean prediction
- **Limited Data**: Only 182 training samples vs 720+ for shorter timeframes
- **High Variance**: Large swings in validation loss during training

**Potential Causes:**
1. **Insufficient Data**: 24h timeframe requires ~288 days of data but has limited historical depth
2. **Feature Mismatch**: Technical indicators optimized for shorter timeframes may not suit daily data
3. **Market Regime Changes**: Daily data spans longer periods with different market conditions

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **24h Model Improvement**:
   - Increase historical data collection (request more days from CoinGecko)
   - Adjust technical indicator parameters for daily timeframe
   - Consider ensemble approach with multiple models

2. **Model Validation**:
   - Implement walk-forward validation
   - Add model diagnostics and residual analysis
   - Monitor prediction accuracy over time

#### Long-term Improvements:
1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Add timeframe-specific indicators
   - Include market sentiment data
   - Implement regime detection

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Experiment with Transformer models
   - Add attention mechanisms
   - Implement multi-timeframe fusion

### Current Model Metrics

#### 4h Model (Best Performer):
- **Training Data**: 720 sequences of 60 timesteps
- **Validation Data**: 180 sequences
- **Architecture**: LSTM (256 hidden, 3 layers)
- **Performance**: R² = 0.5311 (explains 53% of variance)

#### 24h Model (Needs Improvement):
- **Training Data**: 182 sequences of 60 timesteps
- **Validation Data**: 46 sequences  
- **Architecture**: LSTM (256 hidden, 3 layers)
- **Performance**: R² = -1.9305 (worse than baseline)

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Focus on improving 24h model data collection and preprocessing
2. **Short-term**: Implement model monitoring and alerting for performance degradation
3. **Long-term**: Research advanced architectures and ensemble methods
